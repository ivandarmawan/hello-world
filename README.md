# hello-world
My first repository

01. I have created the first branch. Awesome, right?

02. Modify from local repository by Ivan Darmawan

03. Modify from local repository by Fathira Phadina

04. Number 03 seemed failed. It commited by Ivan instead of by Fathira. Now, this is going to be commited from web by Fathira.

05. Let's try again from Fathira's desktop

06. Let see how this conflict will be handled.
